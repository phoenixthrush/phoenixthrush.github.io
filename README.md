> A big, modern, blocky affair with a mobile-style menu, fully responsive styling, <br/>
> and an assortment of pre-styled elements. So, pretty much what you were expecting <br/>
> -- except, of course, for how it's put together, specifically:
> 
> - It's built with components from my Responsive Tools project.
> 
> - It uses flexbox, which eliminates all kinds of terrible hacks and clunky layout <br/>
>   stopgaps (like CSS grid systems).
> 
> - It uses Sass* a lot more intelligently, thanks in part to several new mixins <br/>
>   and functions I've been working on (as well as a few by @HugoGiraudel).
>
>   (* = still entirely optional if you prefer vanilla CSS :)
>
> - A ton of other stuff.
>
> In short, Spectral's the culmination of several new things I'm working on/trying out, <br/>
> so please, let me know what you think :)
>
> Demo images* courtesy of Unsplash, a radtastic collection of CC0 (public domain) images <br/>
> you can use for pretty much whatever.
